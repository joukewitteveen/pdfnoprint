pdfnoprint
----------

This script crops, splits and rotates PDF files for use on eReaders.
There is a hardcoded aspect ratio in the output of 4:3.
The arguments to the script are the desired length (in PostScript points) to
trim off the top, bottom, outside, and inside margins of the input PDF file.
If the inside trim is not specified, it is taken equal to the outside trim.
The script runs on any Unix system that has the pdfjam program, which is part
of the TeX Live distribution of the TeX typesetting system.
